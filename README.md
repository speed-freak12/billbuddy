Bill Buddy is a simple app designed for anyone who wants to better control their monthly budget by tracking all recurring subscriptions and bills in one place. It solves the common problem of losing track of numerous payment due dates and total monthly costs, which often leads to surprise charges and wasted money on unused services. The app provides a clear expense dashboard summarizing your total monthly spending, highlights bills that are due soon to help you pay on time, and allows you to categorize expenses like "Entertainment" or "Utilities" to better understand your spending habits. Built on React and Firebase, Bill Buddy ensures all your data is saved privately and securely, empowering you to avoid late fees and easily identify opportunities to save money.
